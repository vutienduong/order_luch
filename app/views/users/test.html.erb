    The harm is people in the future won't be able to benefit from the brilliant answers everyone shares if there are
    100 of the same question, so closing dupes and redirecting everyone to the original question is better for finding
    best practices and fixes. See stackoverflow.com/help/duplicates for more info on why duplicates are closed. – rncrtr

    This is way more popular than the one it was supposedly duplicating. It's better worded, it has better answers,
    ranks higher on google etc.. So many have benefited from this answer. In retrospect, it would have been a shame if
    this was closed. There are some trivial ones that are bad as duplicates, but this doesn't fall in that category. –
